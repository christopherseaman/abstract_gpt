BACKGROUND: Gamma-tocopherol, the most abundant form of dietary vitamin E, may 
lower the risk of coronary heart disease.
METHODS: We investigated whether dietary and adipose tissue gamma-tocopherol are 
associated with myocardial infarction (MI) in 475 survivors of a first MI and 
479 controls from a population-based study carried out between 1994 and 1998 in 
Costa Rica. Dietary intake was assessed with a validated food-frequency 
questionnaire and an adipose tissue sample. Conditional logistic regression was 
used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: Subjects in the highest quintile of dietary gamma-tocopherol had a 
lower risk of MI compared with those in the lowest quintile (OR = 0.76; 95% CI = 
0.50-1.17, P = 0.02 for trend). This trend was no longer statistically 
substantial in multivariate analysis (P = 0.44). A weak association was found 
for adipose tissue gamma-tocopherol in univariate (OR = 1.46; 95% CI = 
0.94-2.27) and multivariate (OR = 1.31; 95% CI = 0.62-2.76) models. A 
substantial inverse association with MI was found for total dietary vitamin E 
whether supplement users were included or excluded (P = 0.01 and 0.05 for trend, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that gamma-tocopherol does not protect against 
nonfatal MI.
