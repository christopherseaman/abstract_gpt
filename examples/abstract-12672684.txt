In a follow-up study, only 64% of 126,628 US radiologic technologists completed 
a questionnaire during 1994-1997 after two mailings. The authors conducted a 
randomized trial of financial incentives and delivery methods to identify the 
least costly approach for increasing overall participation. They randomly 
selected nine samples of 300 nonresponders each to receive combinations of no, 
1.00 US dollar, 2.00 US dollars, and 5.00 US dollars cash or check incentives 
delivered by first-class mail or Federal Express. Federal Express delivery did 
not achieve greater participation than first-class mail (23.2% vs. 23.7%). In 
analyses pooled across delivery methods, the response was significantly greater 
for the 2.00 US dollar bill (28.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 25.2, 32.7; p 
< 0.0001), 5.00 US dollars check (27.5%, 95% CI: 22.5, 33.0; p = 0.0001), 1.00 
US dollar bill (24.6%, 95% CI: 21.2, 28.3; p = 0.0007), and 2.00 US dollars 
check (21.8%, 95% CI: 18.5, 25.3; p = 0.02) compared with no incentive (16.6%, 
95% CI: 13.7, 19.9). The response increased significantly with increasing 
incentive amounts from 0.00 to 2.00 US dollars cash (p trend < 0.0001). The 2.00 
US dollar bill achieved a 30% greater response than did a 2.00 US dollars check 
(p = 0.005). For incentives sent by first-class mail, the 5.00 US dollars check 
yielded 30% greater participation than did the 2.00 US dollars check (p = 0.07). 
A 1.00 US dollar bill, chosen instead of the 2.00 US dollars bill because of 
substantially lower overall cost and sent by first-class mail to the remaining 
42,717 nonresponders, increased response from 64% to 72%.
