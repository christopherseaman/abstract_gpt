BACKGROUND: Desert dust is assumed to have substantial adverse effects on human 
health. However, the epidemiologic evidence is still inconsistent, mainly 
because previous studies used different metrics for dust exposure and its 
corresponding epidemiologic analysis. We aim to provide a standardized approach 
to the methodology for evaluating the short-term health effects of desert dust.
METHODS: We reviewed the methods commonly used for dust exposure assessment, 
from use of a binary metric for the occurrence of desert dust advections to a 
continuous one for quantifying particulate matter attributable to desert dust. 
We presented alternative time-series Poisson regression models to evaluate the 
dust exposure-mortality association, from the underlying epidemiological and 
policy-relevant questions. A set of practical examples, using a real dataset 
from Rome, Italy, illustrate the different modeling approaches.
RESULTS: We estimate substantial effects of desert dust episodes and particulate 
matter with diameter <10 μm (PM10) on daily mortality. The estimated effect of 
non-desert PM10 was 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4, 3.2) for a 10 μg/m 
rise of PM10 at lag 0 for dust days, 0.4% (95% CI = -0.1, 0.8) for non-dust 
days, and 0.6% (95% CI = -0.5, 2.1) for desert PM10.
CONCLUSION: The standardized modeling approach we propose could be applicable 
elsewhere, in and near hot spots, which could lead to more consistent evidence 
on the health effects of desert dust from future studies.
