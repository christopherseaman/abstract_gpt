BACKGROUND: Several previous studies suggest that maternal stress may be 
associated with increased risk of certain birth defects. This study examined the 
association of maternal stressful life events with risks of several birth 
defects.
METHODS: The data are from a recent, population-based case-control study. 
Telephone interviews were conducted with 1355 eligible case mothers and 700 
control mothers. Maternal stress was measured by responses to 18 yes/no 
questions about life events that occurred from 2 months before through 2 months 
after conception.
RESULTS: An increase in the stressful life events index (ie, number of "yes" 
responses to the 18 life-events questions) was associated with increased risk of 
cleft palate, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, d-transposition of the 
great arteries, and tetralogy of Fallot, after adjustment for maternal 
race-ethnicity, education, obesity, age, smoking, drinking, intake of folic 
acid-containing supplements, neighborhood crime, and food insecurity. For 
example, the odds ratio for a 3-unit change in the stress index was 1.45 (95% 
confidence interval = 1.03-2.06) for cleft palate. Increased stress was 
associated with an increased risk of spina bifida and anencephaly particularly 
among women who did not take folic acid supplements. A 3-unit change in stress 
was associated with a 2.35-fold increased risk of anencephaly among women who 
did not take supplements (CI =1.47-3.77) and a 1.42-fold increased risk among 
women who did (CI = 0.89-2.25).
CONCLUSION: The adverse health effects of stress may include increased risks of 
certain birth defects.
