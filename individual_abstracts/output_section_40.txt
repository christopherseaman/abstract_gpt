In a recent issue of the Journal, Wesselink et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 
2022;191(8):1383-1395) presented findings that indicate that the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine does not cause any reduction in fertility in 
either men or women, while COVID-19 infection may reduce fertility temporarily 
among men. These are reassuring findings for those seeking pregnancy, as well as 
for clinicians and the public. There was no scientific reason to be concerned 
about effects of the COVID-19 vaccine on fertility, so some of the 
psychological, ethical, and historical reasons for concern are discussed. These 
include perceptions of risk around "unnatural," unusual, or dreaded outcomes; 
vaccine resistance as part of a social and political identity; and the tendency 
for moral panics to occur around women's reproductive capacity. On this and 
other topics, there is a broad need for reproductive health to be better 
incorporated into clinical trials, and for fertility research to advance in 
measurement and include a more diverse and global population.
