The American Journal of Epidemiology and Social Epidemiology: Past and Future.

Kawachi I.

Historically, the American Journal of Epidemiology (AJE) has played an important 
role in the development of social epidemiology as a field. To mark the 
centennial of the Journal, we invited commentaries from 3 sets of authors in 
which we asked them to reflect on the role of the AJE in advancing our 
understanding of the social determinants of population health and health 
disparities. Drs. Lisa Berkman, Mauricio Avendano, and Emilie Courtin discuss 
the promises and pitfalls of using experimental data (from both randomized 
trials and natural policy experiments) to interrogate the causal connection 
between social determinants and population health outcomes. Drs. Julie Palmer, 
Yvette Crozier, and Lynn Rosenberg look back on the first 25 years of the Black 
Women's Health Study and the contributions of that study to our understanding of 
racial disparities in health. Drs. Luisa Borrell and Natalie Crawford review the 
AJE's contributions to the definition and use of race and ethnicity in 
epidemiologic research and make recommendations for strengthening diversity and 
inclusion in the profession. A common thread that emerges across the invited 
essays is the AJE's commitment to publishing articles that engage in critical 
self-reflection of the discipline.
