Lesko et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2022;191(12):2063-2070) propose a framework for 
descriptive epidemiology. This framework helps lay out some of the key issues in 
producing a useful descriptive work. Lesko et al. help emphasize the importance 
and value of descriptive work in epidemiology and public health. In this 
commentary, related issues are discussed and open questions are raised.
