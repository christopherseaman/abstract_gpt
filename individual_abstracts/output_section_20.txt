Deep Learning for Epidemiologists: An Introduction to Neural Networks.

Serghiou S, Rough K.

Deep learning methods are increasingly being applied to problems in medicine and 
health care. However, few epidemiologists have received formal training in these 
methods. To bridge this gap, this article introduces the fundamentals of deep 
learning from an epidemiologic perspective. Specifically, this article reviews 
core concepts in machine learning (e.g., overfitting, regularization, and 
hyperparameters); explains several fundamental deep learning architectures 
(convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks); and summarizes 
training, evaluation, and deployment of models. Conceptual understanding of 
supervised learning algorithms is the focus of the article; instructions on the 
training of deep learning models and applications of deep learning to causal 
learning are out of this article's scope. We aim to provide an accessible first 
step towards enabling the reader to read and assess research on the medical 
applications of deep learning and to familiarize readers with deep learning 
terminology and concepts to facilitate communication with computer scientists 
and machine learning engineers.
