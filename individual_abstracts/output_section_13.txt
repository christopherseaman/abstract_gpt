Toward Open and Reproducible Epidemiology.

Mathur MB, Fox MP.

Starting in the 2010s, researchers in the experimental social sciences rapidly 
began to adopt increasingly open and reproducible scientific practices. These 
practices include publicly sharing deidentified data when possible, sharing 
analytical code, and preregistering study protocols. Empirical evidence from the 
social sciences suggests such practices are feasible, can improve analytical 
reproducibility, and can reduce selective reporting. In academic epidemiology, 
adoption of open-science practices has been slower than in the social sciences 
(with some notable exceptions, such as registering clinical trials). 
Epidemiologic studies are often large, complex, conceived after data have 
already been collected, and difficult to replicate directly by collecting new 
data. These characteristics make it especially important to ensure their 
integrity and analytical reproducibility. Open-science practices can also pay 
immediate dividends to researchers' own work by clarifying scientific reasoning 
and encouraging well-documented, organized workflows. We consider how 
established epidemiologists and early-career researchers alike can help midwife 
a culture of open science in epidemiology through their research practices, 
mentorship, and editorial activities.
