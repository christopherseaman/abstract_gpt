The Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO)-Wide Cohort Study 
(EWC), a collaborative research design comprising 69 cohorts in 31 consortia, 
was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2016 to improve 
children's health in the United States. The EWC harmonizes extant data and 
collects new data using a standardized protocol, the ECHO-Wide Cohort Data 
Collection Protocol (EWCP). EWCP visits occur at least once per life stage, but 
the frequency and timing of the visits vary across cohorts. As of March 4, 2022, 
the EWC cohorts contributed data from 60,553 children and consented 29,622 
children for new EWCP data and biospecimen collection. The median (interquartile 
range) age of EWCP-enrolled children was 7.5 years (3.7-11.1). Surveys, 
interviews, standardized examinations, laboratory analyses, and medical record 
abstraction are used to obtain information in 5 main outcome areas: pre-, peri-, 
and postnatal outcomes; neurodevelopment; obesity; airways; and positive health. 
Exposures include factors at the level of place (e.g., air pollution, 
neighborhood socioeconomic status), family (e.g., parental mental health), and 
individuals (e.g., diet, genomics).
