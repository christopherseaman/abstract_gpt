Can Cross-Sectional Studies Contribute to Causal Inference? It Depends.

Cross-sectional studies-often defined as those in which exposure and outcome are 
assessed at the same point in time-are frequently viewed as minimally 
informative for causal inference. While cross-sectional studies may be 
susceptible to reverse causality, may be limited to assessment of disease 
prevalence rather than incidence, or may only provide estimates of current 
rather than past exposures, not all cross-sectional studies suffer these 
limitations. Moreover, none of these concerns are unique to or inherent in the 
structure of a cross-sectional study. Regardless of when exposure and disease 
were ascertained relative to one another, a cross-sectional study may provide 
insights into the causal effects of exposure on disease incidence. Simply 
labeling a study as "cross-sectional" and assuming that 1 or more of these 
limitations exist and are materially important fails to recognize the need for a 
more nuanced assessment and risks discarding evidence that may be useful in 
assessing causal relationships.
