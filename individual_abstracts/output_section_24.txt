Peripheral Neuropathy and Vision and Hearing Impairment in US Adults With and 
Without Diabetes.

We aimed to assess the associations of peripheral neuropathy (PN) with vision 
and hearing impairment among adults aged ≥40 years who attended the 
lower-extremity disease exam for the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (United States, 1999-2004). Overall, 11.8% (standard error (SE), 0.5) of 
adults had diabetes, 13.2% (SE, 0.5) had PN (26.6% (SE, 1.4) with diabetes, 
11.4% (SE, 0.5) without diabetes), 1.6% (SE, 0.1) had vision impairment, and 
15.4% (SE, 1.1) had hearing impairment. The prevalence of vision impairment was 
3.89% (95% CI: 2.99, 5.05) among adults with PN and 1.29% (95% CI: 1.04, 1.60) 
among adults without PN (P < 0.001). After adjustment, PN was associated with 
vision impairment overall (odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.03, 2.13) and among adults without diabetes (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.17, 2.77) 
but not among adults with diabetes (P for interaction = 0.018). The prevalence 
of hearing impairment was 26.5% (95% CI: 20.4, 33.7) among adults with PN and 
14.2% (95% CI: 12.4, 16.3) among adults without PN (P < 0.001). The association 
of PN with moderate/severe hearing impairment was significant overall (OR = 
2.55, 95% CI: 1.40, 4.64) and among adults without diabetes (OR = 3.26, 95% CI: 
1.80, 5.91). Overall, these findings suggest an association between peripheral 
and audiovisual sensory impairment that is unrelated to diabetes.
