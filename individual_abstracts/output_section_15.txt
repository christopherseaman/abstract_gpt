Cost-Efficient Multiply Matched Case-Control Study Designs.

Sandoval GJ, Bebu I, Lachin JM.

In multiply matched case-control studies, a number of cases and controls may be 
included in each matched set. However, when per-participant costs between cases 
and controls differ, investigators should be aware of how the numbers of cases 
and controls per matched set affect the overall total study cost. Traditional 
statistical approaches to designing case-control studies do not account for 
study costs. Given an effect size, the power to detect differences is typically 
a function of the numbers of cases and controls within each matched set. 
Therefore, the same level of statistical power will be achieved based on various 
combinations of the numbers of cases and controls. Typical matched case-control 
studies match a case to a number of controls by levels of 1 or more known 
factors. Several authors have shown that for study designs with 1 case per 
matched set, the optimal number of controls within each matched set that 
minimizes the total study cost is the square root of the ratio of the cost of a 
case to the cost of a control. Herein, we extend this result to the setting of a 
multiply matched case-control study design, when 1 or more cases are matched to 
controls within each matched set. A Shiny web application implementation of the 
proposed methods is presented.
