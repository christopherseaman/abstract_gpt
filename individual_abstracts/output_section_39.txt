Why Epidemiology Is Incomplete Without Qualitative and Mixed Methods.

Lane-Fall MB.

Epidemiology has traditionally used quantitative approaches to characterizing 
disease prevalence and studying the effects of medical and public health 
interventions. Despite the power of such methods, they leave important gaps in 
understanding population health that can be addressed using qualitative and 
mixed methods. In this commentary, I describe philosophical differences in 
qualitative and quantitative approaches to research and explain how they can be 
used together to strengthen epidemiologic inquiry.
