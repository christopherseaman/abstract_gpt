The Future of Causal Inference.

Mitra N, Roy J, Small D.

The past several decades have seen exponential growth in causal inference 
approaches and their applications. In this commentary, we provide our top-10 
list of emerging and exciting areas of research in causal inference. These 
include methods for high-dimensional data and precision medicine, causal machine 
learning, causal discovery, and others. These methods are not meant to be an 
exhaustive list; instead, we hope that this list will serve as a springboard for 
stimulating the development of new research.
