We estimated the trends and correlates of vaccine hesitancy and its association 
with subsequent vaccine uptake among 5,458 adults in the United States. 
Participants belonged to the Communities, Households, and SARS-CoV-2 
Epidemiology COVID (CHASING COVID) Cohort, a national longitudinal study. Trends 
and correlates of vaccine hesitancy were examined longitudinally in 8 interview 
rounds from October 2020 to July 2021. We also estimated the association between 
willingness to vaccinate and subsequent vaccine uptake through July 2021. 
Vaccine delay and refusal decreased from 51% and 8% in October 2020 to 8% and 6% 
in July 2021, respectively. Compared with non-Hispanic (NH) White participants, 
NH Black and Hispanic participants had higher adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for 
both vaccine delay (for NH Black, aOR = 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5, 
2.7), and for Hispanic, 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.7)) and vaccine refusal (for NH 
Black, aOR = 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8, 3.6), and for Hispanic, 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.0)) 
in June 2021. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, compared with vaccine-willingness, was 
associated with lower odds of subsequent vaccine uptake (for vaccine delayers, 
aOR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.18; for vaccine refusers, aOR = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01, 
0.03 ), adjusted for sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 history. Vaccination 
awareness and distribution efforts should focus on vaccine delayers.
