Snippets of the History of the American Journal of Epidemiology.

Szklo M.

In this article, I present a brief summary of landmark events in the American 
Journal of Epidemiology, including its founding, the first few decades, the 
change in name, the increasing focus on nontransmissible disease, and selected 
key manuscripts. A list of developments that will likely result in new papers 
submitted to epidemiology journals are also described, and they include themes 
such as consequential epidemiology and the use of artificial intelligence 
methods in epidemiologic data analyses.
