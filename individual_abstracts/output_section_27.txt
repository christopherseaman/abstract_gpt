Interaction Contrasts and Collider Bias.

Mansournia MA, Nazemipour M, Etminan M.

Previous papers have mentioned that conditioning on a binary collider would 
introduce an association between its causes in at least 1 stratum. In this 
paper, we prove this statement and, along with intuitions, formally examine the 
direction and magnitude of the associations between 2 risk factors of a binary 
collider using interaction contrasts. Among level one of the collider, 2 
variables are independent, positively associated, and negatively associated if 
multiplicative risk interaction contrast is equal to, more than, and less than 
0, respectively; the same results hold for the other level of the collider if 
the multiplicative survival interaction contrast, equal to multiplicative risk 
interaction contrast minus the additive risk interaction contrast, is compared 
with 0. The strength of the association depends on the magnitude of the 
interaction contrast: The stronger the interaction is, the larger the magnitude 
of the association will be. However, the common conditional odds ratio under the 
homogeneity assumption will be bounded. A figure is presented that succinctly 
illustrates our results and helps researchers to better visualize the 
associations introduced upon conditioning on a collider.
